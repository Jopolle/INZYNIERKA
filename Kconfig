config UI_THREAD_STACK_SIZE
	int "UI thread stack size"
	default 4096
	help
	  Stack size (in bytes) used by the LVGL UI thread. Increase this
	  value when adding widgets that need more stack during creation.

config UI_THREAD_PRIORITY
	int "UI thread priority"
	default 5
	range 1 15
	help
	  Cooperative priority of the UI thread. Lower numbers are higher
	  priority. Adjust if the UI should preempt other workloads.

config UI_REFRESH_PERIOD_MS
	int "UI loop period (ms)"
	default 16
	range 5 100
	help
	  Period used by the UI thread between LVGL handler calls. Values

	int "UI model queue depth"
	default 8
	range 1 32
	help
	  Number of buffered data snapshots for the UI. Increase if the

	  them.

	  When enabled, a lightweight worker periodically publishes
